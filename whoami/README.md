# coreutils - whoami

A re-implementation of the coreutils `whoami` program written in Go. This is inspired by the [Ubuntu uutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) project written in Rust.

This tool hasn't been tested against the GNU coreutils program of the same name, but I intend to at some point.
