# Go Coreutils

This is my attempt at rewriting the GNU coreutils utlities, but based on the [Ubuntu uutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) project written in Rust.

Primarily, this project is intended to help my Go programming ability. The project is open-ended with no deadline. I have no expectation of matching the coreutils 100%, but I'm positive what I learn along the journey will be well worth it.

Second, I'm intrigued by what these tools will (and do) look like written in more modern languages. Both in terms of the safety a language like Rust (and Go) bring but also by the build system such lanaguages introduce compared to the C build system in GNU.
